# Specs: TUI Install Flow

## Domain: tui-install-flow

### Requirement: Configuration Screen

The Configuration screen MUST offer language (EN/ES) and persistence backend (Engram/Files/Both) selectors. Engram option SHALL be disabled when MCP is not detected. Tab SHALL switch focus between Language and Persistence fields. Up, Down, Left, and Right arrows SHALL cycle the options within the currently active field.

| # | Scenario | GIVEN | WHEN | THEN |
|---|----------|-------|------|------|
| 7 | Engram available | Engram MCP detected | Config renders | "Engram" option selectable |
| 8 | Engram unavailable | Engram MCP not detected | Config renders | "Engram" greyed out with "(not detected)" note |
| 9 | Proceed | User selects options | Enter pressed | Transitions to Install Progress |
| 10 | Tab switches field | Language field focused | User presses Tab | Persistence field becomes focused |
| 11 | Up/Down cycles options | Language field focused, "English" selected | User presses Down | Selection cycles to "Español" |
| 12 | Left/Right cycles options | Persistence field focused, "Files" selected | User presses Right | Selection cycles to "Both" |

### Requirement: Install Progress Screen

The Install Progress screen MUST show per-tool step-by-step progress with a spinner while running. A goroutine SHALL execute `Install()` or `Uninstall()` and send `ProgressMsg` events through a buffered channel. The UI MUST remain responsive during execution. The title SHALL display "Installing" when `OperationMode` is `"install"` and "Uninstalling" when `OperationMode` is `"uninstall"`. The summary line SHALL display "Installing N of M tools" or "Uninstalling N of M tools" accordingly.

| # | Scenario | GIVEN | WHEN | THEN |
|---|----------|-------|------|------|
| 10 | Happy path | 1 tool selected, mode=install | Install runs | Steps: `[ ] Skills` → spinner → `[✓] Skills` → `[✓] Commands` → `[✓] System Prompt` |
| 11 | Multi-tool parallel | 2 tools selected, mode=install | Install runs | Independent progress blocks for each tool |
| 12 | Step failure | Install goroutine errors | Step fails | `[✗]` with error message; remaining steps skipped; Error screen |
| 13 | All success | All tools/steps complete | Last step finishes | Transitions to Complete screen |
| 14 | Uninstall progress label | mode=uninstall, 1 tool | Uninstall runs | Title "Uninstalling"; summary "Uninstalling 1 of 1 tools" |
| 15 | Install progress label | mode=install, 2 tools, 1 complete | During install | Title "Installing"; summary "Installing 1 of 2 tools" |

### Requirement: Complete Screen

The Complete screen MUST list succeeded tools and show the first command to try (`/sequoia-init`). `q` exits the TUI. The heading SHALL display "Installation Complete!" when `OperationMode` is `"install"` and "Uninstallation Complete!" when `OperationMode` is `"uninstall"`.

| # | Scenario | GIVEN | WHEN | THEN |
|---|----------|-------|------|------|
| 14 | All succeeded — install | 2 of 2 installed, mode=install | Install finishes | Heading "Installation Complete!"; both listed with ✅; `/sequoia-init` hint |
| 15 | Partial success | 1 succeeded, 1 failed | Install finishes | Succeeded shown here; failed deferred to Error screen |
| 16 | Uninstall complete | 2 of 2 uninstalled, mode=uninstall | Uninstall finishes | Heading "Uninstallation Complete!"; tools listed as removed |

### Requirement: Error Screen

The Error screen MUST list failed tools with error messages. `r` MUST trigger retry of failed tools only, rebuilding the pipeline. `q` MUST quit while preserving partial state. The heading SHALL display "Installation Failed" when `OperationMode` is `"install"` and "Uninstallation Failed" when `OperationMode` is `"uninstall"`.

| # | Scenario | GIVEN | WHEN | THEN |
|---|----------|-------|------|------|
| 16 | Retry — install mode | 1 tool failed, mode=install | User presses `r` | Pipeline rebuilt for failed tool; returns to Progress with "Installing" |
| 17 | Quit on error | 1 tool failed | User presses `q` | TUI exits; partial install state preserved |
| 18 | Uninstall error heading | 1 tool uninstall failed, mode=uninstall | Error screen shown | Heading "Uninstallation Failed"; failed tool listed |
| 19 | Retry — uninstall mode | 1 tool uninstall failed, mode=uninstall | User presses `r` | Pipeline rebuilt for failed tool; returns to Progress with "Uninstalling" |
